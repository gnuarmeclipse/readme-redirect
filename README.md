# readme-redirect

The [GNU ARM Eclipse](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse) project was recently extended to include support for RISC-V devices, and since it is now multi-platform, it is rebranding as [GNU MCU Eclipse](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse).

* the [gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins](https://gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins) repository was moved to [gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins);
* the [gnuarmeclipse/openocd](https://gnuarmeclipse/openocd) repository was moved to [gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd);
* the [gnuarmeclipse/qemu](https://gnuarmeclipse/qemu) repository was moved to [gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu).

GitHub normally keeps a redirect, so old URLs should be fine for a while.

We apologise for any inconvenience that this may have caused.
